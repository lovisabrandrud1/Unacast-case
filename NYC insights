/*Task 2: Insights about areas in NYC
The task is very open: Imagine being a Data Scientist at either NY Citibikes or e.g. the city of
New York, and your team lead has asked you to find interesting insights (preferably actionable)
about areas in NYC. We encourage you to use supplementing data sets to the Citibikes dataset,
many can be found readily available on BigQuery.
It can be useful to use geohash, census tracts or another way of grouping the data in
manageable areas.
In this task we want you to focus on the presentation. Think of what is the best medium to
explore the data and explain your findings. During the interview you’ll have 20 minutes to
present.
NB: We expect that you use the dataset creatively. All assumptions don’t have to make 100%
sense but we expect you to be able to describe why you used the data in the way you did.


I am for a hypothesis driven approach, not just digging around in data.
Hypotheses should be based on what they want to acheive on a higher level grounded in a strategy, ensuring that you are actually working in the direction of actionable insights.
The Hypotheses can then be confirmed or disproved

Here an exmaple could be the nyc government considering adjusting the public transport offer in accordance with the weather
Or NY citibike looking to improve how they reallocate bikes and have an hyptohesis that weather has great impact 
- difficult to estimate demand as we have no idea when stations are empty or full
    - can use nearby stations as proxy
    - can use same station at other days as proxy 
- hypotheses, the most popular routes for tourist are more affected by weather than annual subscribers

Assumptions:
- unlimited supply of bicycles at the stations
- same number of spaces/comparable stations
- all stations active all of 2017
 concept
 how can we estimate demand with regards to how to move bikes around
 weather
 usertype
 peak times
 area demands
 --> map (geoviz) which shows how many bikes we assume will be needed at a specific station within a specific hour, specific day and type of weather
 improvement: include actual number of bikes at satation at given time, more sophisticated calculation on temperature range (linear regression)
 other factors (wind, holidays, festivals, etc), estimate of demand at times where the station has been empty (nearby stations, same station and time different day)
