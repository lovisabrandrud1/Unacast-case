Task 2: Insights about areas in NYC
The task is very open: Imagine being a Data Scientist at either NY Citibikes or e.g. the city of
New York, and your team lead has asked you to find interesting insights (preferably actionable)
about areas in NYC. We encourage you to use supplementing data sets to the Citibikes dataset,
many can be found readily available on BigQuery.
It can be useful to use geohash, census tracts or another way of grouping the data in
manageable areas.
In this task we want you to focus on the presentation. Think of what is the best medium to
explore the data and explain your findings. During the interview you’ll have 20 minutes to
present.
NB: We expect that you use the dataset creatively. All assumptions don’t have to make 100%
sense but we expect you to be able to describe why you used the data in the way you did.
